To create an interactive form with validation in React, follow these steps:

*Manage Form Data: Use React's useState to store the form data (like name, email, password) and any error messages.

*Capture User Input: Set up form fields (e.g., text inputs for name and email) that update the state as the user types. This makes the form interactive.

*Validate Input: When the user tries to submit the form, check if the fields are filled out correctly:

Is the name provided?

Is the email in the correct format?

Is the password long enough?

*Display Errors: If something is wrong, show an error message next to the relevant field (e.g., "Email is required" or "Password is too short").

*Submit the Form: If everything is correct, you can submit the data; otherwise, prevent submission and ask the user to fix the errors.
